    Congratulations to Kangxue, whose work <b>LOGAN: Unpaired Shape Transform in Latent Overcomplete Space</b> will be featured for press release at SIGGRAPH Asia 2019!<br><br>LOGAN is able to learn what shape features to preserve during shape translation, either local or non-local, whether content or style, depending solely on the input domains for training, which was an improvement over the state of the art.<br><br>LOGAN is an abbreviation for Latent Overcomplete GAN. Richard Zhang, who is also the last author, created the fun acronym.<br><br>

    Richard's SGP Keynote Speech
  text: >-
    Richard Zhang was featured in the Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) as a keynote speaker! His speech was titled “Can Machines Learn to Generate 3D Shapes?”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In his talk, Richard highlighted the representation, data, and output challenges that researchers must tackle and how his research has shaped itself to address these challenges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the key issues in this domain is not generate shapes that look right; instead, they need to serve their intended function while displaying the right part connections, arrangements, and geometry.

    Xiaoming Liu Visits SFU
  text: >-
    <a href"http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm" target="_blank">Dr. Xiaoming Liu</a> visited SFU today following an invitation from Dr. Yasutaka Furukawa! His talk titled "Inverse Graphics for 3D Modeling and Reconstruction: from Face to Generic Objects" has the following abstract: <br><br>"Reconstructing the detailed and complete 3D surface of an object from a single 2D image is a long standing computer vision problem. In this talk, we present an inverse graphics-based framework to learn a 3D face model from a large set of in-the-wild 2D face images, without the need of capturing 3D scans. We also extend this framework to high-fidelity face modeling, as well as generic object modeling and 3D reconstruction. In the end, we will briefly overview other research efforts in the Computer Vision Lab at Michigan State University, including face anti-spoofing, explainable recognition, early sensor fusion of LiDAR and RGB, 2D/3D object detection from urban driving videos, etc."

    The GrUVi team congratulates Kangxue Yin, whom received the prestigious Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Self-financed Students Abroad!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This award was established in 2003 by the&nbsp;<a title="China Scholarship Council" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Scholarship_Council">China Scholarship Council</a>. The worldwide recipients are chosen annually based on a record of outstanding accomplishments in any discipline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This award is considered the highest award given by Chinese government for Chinese graduate students studying abroad who do not receive regular financial support from Chinese government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, this award is granted to only 500 students every year. Since there are around half a million Chinese students to study abroad per year, this a highly competitive award. For the academic year 2018, only 6 awardees were based in British Columbia, Canada. Among them, Kangxue was the only student majoring in Computer Science.

    Gruviers Volunteered for SIG'2018
  text: >-
    Two gruviers were student volunteers (SV) at the SIGGRAPH 2018 conference. While the attendees were certainly thankful for all the work that all the volunteers put in the event, our gruvi volunteers described how valuable the experience was for them! Zhiqin got the chance to use the hardware available at the exhibition hall to print the awesome gruvi logo on the hat shown in the picture. He described the great impact that experiencing the latest developments on VR technology had on him:<br /><br /> "I'm honored to be a student volunteer of such a great conference. VR was definitely a highlight of SIGGRAPH 2018. There were many showcases of applying haptic technology to VR and utilizing VR for designing and creating content. The immersive pavilion was awesome and provided me all kinds of VR experiences. I am looking forward to next SIGGRAPH!"<br /><br />Akshay, on the other hand, emphasized the connections he was able to forge during his time as a volunteer:<br /><br />"This was my first SIGGRAPH and my first time as a SIG-SV. The kind of atmosphere, the exuberance of energy and experience that I felt was surreal and I was left wanting for more when it ended. Memories of a lifetime with awesome fellow SV's, coordinating various programs and above all, the latest technology!! Definitely want to relive this again at SIG'19."

    A special event honouring Professor Eugene Fiume, on the occasion of his 60-th birthday, was held at the SFU Harbour Center on August 17, right after SIGGRAPH 2018. Many of Eugene's first-generation PhDs from the University of Toronto attended the celebratory workshop and gave their account of fun and inspiring stories about what it was like to be his graduate students. Eugene's computer graphics instructor during his undergraduate years at the University of Waterloo provided hint of how Eugene was already "ahead of the class" then. The event featured Prof. Pat Hanrahan from Stanford University, as the keynote speaker. Pat spoke of "theory vs. practice" to highlight how over the years, Eugene has been among the rare group of people in computer graphics, who have emphasized the importance of theory in the field.

  headline: Jaime's Sucessful Msc Thesis Defense
  text: Congrats to Jaime for successfully defending his MSC thesis on "Towards Learning of a Joint Geometry-Structure Manifold for Shape Exploration".<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of his thesis.<br /><br /> We present a first attempt at producing a continuous generative model of 3D objects from a joint representation that incorporates the discrete structural variability as well as the continuous geometric variability that are often present in collections of man-made shapes. Starting from a set of compatibly segmented shapes, our main contribution consists in demonstrating the construction of the joint representation. Then, by using Gaussian Process learning to produce a predictive manifold from the joint representation, we investigate its capabilities and limitations for reproducing and synthesizing new shapes.

  headline: Warunika's Successful Msc Thesis Defense
  text: Congrats to Warunika for successfully defending her MSc thesis on "ExquiMo&#58; An Exquisite Corpse Tool for Co-Creative 3D Shape Modeling". The researchers&nbsp;would like to assure you that no person, dog, or any other animals were killed as the result of conducting this thesis research.<br /><br /> Here is the abstract of her work:<br /><br /> We introduce a shape modeling tool, ExquiMo, which is guided by the idea of improving the creativity of 3D shape designs through collaboration. Inspired by the game of Exquisite Corpse, our tool allocates distinct parts of a shape to multiple players who model the assigned parts in a sequence. Our approach is motivated by the understanding that effective surprise leads to creative outcomes. Hence, to maintain the surprise factor of the output, we conceal the previously modeled parts from the most recent player. Part designs from individual players are fused together to produce an often unexpected, hence creative, end result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative modeling for both man-made and natural shapes. Our results show that, when compared to models designed by individual users, multi-user collaborative modeling via ExquiMo tends to lead to more creative designs in terms of the most common criteria used to identify creative artifacts.
